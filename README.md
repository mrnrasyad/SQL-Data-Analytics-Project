Results
#### **Orders** by **Payment Method**
PayPal leads as the most used payment method, with credit and debit cards close behind. However, completed orders (88) are only slightly higher than pending (85) and cancelled (77), showing that many transactions fail to finish â€” a sign of possible issues in processing or customer follow-through.
